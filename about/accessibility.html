<p>The WI+RE team strives to continually improve the accessibility of our open educational resources. We are currently creating the following inventory of the accessibility status for each of our resources. This report will include the how we have tested and evaluated the accessibility of each resource as well as known issues and the things we are currently working on. As a part of these efforts, please <a href="https://uclalibrary.githib.io/research-tips/contact/" target="_blank">report any accessibility concerns and let us know how we can improve</a> our work.</p>
