bio: >- 
   Shannon worked with the WI+RE Team for two years, right as the project was getting started. Through WI+RE she was able to explore and build a variety of new skills like html coding on the WI+RE website, video editing on projects such as “Reading Strategies,” and simple animation like in “Expanding Perspectives.” Most of all Shannon took away a passion for the collaborative design process and for instructional design. Shannon is currently using and building this passion as a 3-4th grade special education teacher in Chicago.
