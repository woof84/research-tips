For every project, WI+RE goes through an extensive process of prototyping and receiving feedback. [Wheel of Sources](https://woof84.github.io/research-tips/primary-secondary/) was no exception: from notecard sketches to drag-and-drop games, our prototypes encompassed a wide range of media and design concepts.
