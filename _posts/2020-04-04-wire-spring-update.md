WI+RE has been working quickly over the past few weeks to pivot into remote collaboration and communication mode! We are up and running and ready to help.

Please let us know your thoughts on our upcoming projects and next steps. We would love to hear more about how we can help with synchronous and asynchronous remote learning. Let us know how we can help!

## How to integrate WI+RE workshops into your CCLE courses

Want to integrate WI+RE workshops directly into your own webpage or CCLE course site? No problem! You can follow this [how-to guide from Humtech](https://humtech.ucla.edu/how-to/embed-wire-workshops-in-your-course-site/) or [contact us directly](https://uclalibrary.github.io/research-tips/contact/)!

## New website: CREATES for reading and analyzing scientific articles

WI+RE is thrilled to announce that through our collaboration with Jordan Moberg Parker, Director of Undergraduate Laboratory Curriculum and Assessment in Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics, we're launching the <a href="https://uclalibrary.github.io/creates/" target="_blank">CREATES website</a>!

    <figcaption class="figure-caption">Introducing the new <a href="https://uclalibrary.github.io/creates/" target="_blank">CREATES website!</a></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>C.R.E.A.T.E.S. is a set of 6 steps that help learners read and critically analyze scientific papers. The C.R.E.A.T.E.S. method, pioneered by Dr. Sally Hoskins, has a demonstrated positive impact on undergraduate students' self-confidence in scientific reading, as well as in their general perceptions of and beliefs about science and scientific thinking (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1187/cbe.11-03-0027" target="_blank">Hoskins, et. al, 2017</a>).</p>

<p>The new <a href="https://uclalibrary.github.io/creates/" target="_blank">C.R.E.A.T.E.S.</a> site uses interactive media, step-by-step directions, and detailed annotation of authentic examples to guide students through the process.</p>

<p>Many thanks to Dr. Jordan Moberg Parker for serving as the Pedagogy Lead on this project, for providing the initial set of instructional materials and examples of student work, and for contributing countless hours providing feedback and advice to make the project possible! BIG, big, big congratulations to Kian and Alex for building the website and creating the multimedia! And we are also very grateful to our many project contributors: Salma Abumeeiz, Giselle Burns, Juan DÃ­az, Taylor Harper, Royson Lin, Christopher Lopez, Renee Romero, Hannah Sutherland, and April Zhou! Thank you for all the help along the way!</p>

## New Workshop Series: Entering Research

WI+RE recently launched three new workshops as part of the new [Entering Research](https://uclalibrary.github.io/research-tips/workshops/#entering-research-workshops) Workshop series. This series of workshops comes as a result of our ongoing partnership with the Undergraduate Research Centers. 

The three new workshops include essential tips on [Beginning Your Research Journey](https://uclalibrary.github.io/research-tips/workshops/beginning-your-research-journey/), getting to know [Research Logistics](https://uclalibrary.github.io/research-tips/workshops/research-logistics/) at UCLA, as well as a [Finding a Research Mentor](https://uclalibrary.github.io/research-tips/workshops/finding-a-mentor-or-project/), which addresses what can be one of the biggest challenges with undergraduate research!

Many thanks to our co-authors on these workshops: Giselle Burns, Kian Ravaei, and Xinyi Yan!!! Thanks also to Janet Goins, Kelly Kistner, Tama Hasson, Renee Romero, Doug Worsham for extensive contributions - from the initial learning outcomes to the published workshops!

Please take a look and let us know your feedback! We are currently looking for instructors and programs that would like to integrate these workshops!

## New UCLA Course: Learner-Led Design for STEM

Renee Romero and Doug Worsham are co-teaching 2 special sessions of Life Science 192E called "Learner-Led Design for STEM." This partnership with the CEILS Learning Assistant (LA)  program was created to foster the learner-led design of instructional materials based on the experiences and insights of LA's. WI+RE is grateful to all of the LA's that have signed up for the course and we're looking forward to creating together!! Big thanks also to Dr. Shanna Shaked, Senior Associate Director of CEILS, for making this experiement a reality!! Thanks also to the UCLA Center for the Advancement of Teaching for funding this initiative through the [Instructional Improvement Grant](https://www.teaching.ucla.edu/grants/iip) program!!

<a name="website-release"></a>
## WI+RE Website Release: v2.1

We've incorporated tons of new features in this release, including: 

* Handouts are now included as embedded PDFs for improved accessibility
* Redesigned search page - now includes giant list of content
* Publications, presentations, awards and peer-reviews are now listed on portfolio pages

## Team member spotlight: Royson Lin

    <img class="mx-auto img-fluid" src="https://uclalibrary.github.io/research-tips/assets/images/team/royson.jpg" alt="Royson Lin in a bookstore" >
</div>

It seems like only yesterday that [Royson Lin](https://uclalibrary.github.io/research-tips/about/creative-team/royson/) joined the WI+RE Creative Team. Graduating this winter quarter with a major in Cognitive Science, Royson helped WI+RE on a number of projects, including a recently published [Google Scholar Tutorial](https://uclalibrary.github.io/research-tips/google-scholar/), which has already earned a 5-star review on MERLOT. Royson finished up his time with WI+RE by creating an awesome [study tips playlist](https://uclalibrary.github.io/research-tips/sandbox/resource-playlist-study-tips/) which outlines top tips on learning and memory from the field of cognitive science. It is well worth a read!

We wish Royson the best and look forward to hearing where he goes next with his creativity and design skills!

## Work in progress!

### Writing Tips with the Undergraduate Writing Center PLFs

We are very excited about our ongoing collaboration with the Writing Center Peer Learning Facilitators (PLFs). We're currently working with Christine Holten, UG Writing Center Director, and the PLF team to create a series of writing tips tutorials. Last quarter, the PLFs collaborated with WI+RE to identify top writing challenges from their experience helping writers at UCLA, and now we're working on storyboards and scripts. It should be a great series!

### New project ideas from Library staff

Library staff from across UCLA have shared a large set of ideas for future projects on everything from using images as evidence, to finding open data sources, to navigating finding aids and searching for primary sources. We're thrilled with this big collection of new ideas and looking forward to next steps! Get ready to empathy map and make learning outcomes!
