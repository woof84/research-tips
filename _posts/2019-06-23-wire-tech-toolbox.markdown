Curious to know how WI+RE puts together our online learning modules? While it is true that the most important part of our work is the [learner-led design process](https://uclalibrary.github.io/research-tips/about/design-toolkit/), technology tools play an important role as well. Here's a quick list of WI+RE's current toolbox, with links to some of the tutorials new WI+RE designers use to get to know these tools.

### [Asana](https://asana.com/)

WI+RE makes *extensive* use of a free [Asana](https://asana.com/) account. It is our most important online communication tool and has become absolutely essential for both onboarding and project management. We really like how it helps foster asynchronous collaboration and communication for a team of student designers with variable and flexible work schedules! 

### HTML and CSS (bootstrap)

The foundation for our web work, we use free tutorials on [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html) to get to know the basics of html and css. We also find ourselves constantly refering to [https://getbootstrap.com/docs/](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/) to tinker with the bootstrap CSS framework.

### Markdown

We also use quite a bit of markdown for web work. WI+RE students have liked this [quick markdown tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/)

### Github and github pages

[Github](http://github.com/) and [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) are essential tools for WI+RE as we use them to host our website and tutorials! We use github pages because: it is free, it let's us build a pretty robust website but doesn't use a database to serve up pages (which means there are very few security concerns), and it allows us to share our code freely on one of the world's largest open code-sharing sites! WI+RE students start learning GitHub using this [getting started guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

### H5P

Many of our recent projects - including the [Cornerstone Research Workshop Series](https://uclalibrary.github.io/research-tips/workshops/) and [Wheel of Sources](https://uclalibrary.github.io/research-tips/primary-secondary/) - use [H5P](https://h5p.org/) to add interactive elements to videos and slideshows.

### Creative Commons

Perhaps not really a "technology" in the traditional sense, but we use and talk about creative commons quite a bit, so new WI+RE students watch and discuss a [short video on creative commons and how it works](https://vimeo.com/13590841)

### [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/)

We use [the audacity site itself](https://www.audacityteam.org/) to introduce this free and super handy audio recording program.

### [Hype](https://tumult.com/hype/)

One of only a few paid applications in the WI+RE toolbox, Hype has been a key tool for many of our projects. We use it to create HTML5 animations. WI+RE students get to know Hype primarily through experimentation as they create their [learning narrative videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRPedAkolOOC6z-iP2S-clQ), but we use [introductory YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8xqJHJIyfw) to get them started. 

### [Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/)

We also have a paid account for [Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/) b/c it is awesome! You'll see visuals from the noun project throughout WI+RE's work and so having a paid account is super important for us. Having quick access to a massive collection of well designed visuals has become essential to WI+RE's process. Oh, and we also sometimes use [https://fontawesome.com/](https://fontawesome.com/) for icons as well!
