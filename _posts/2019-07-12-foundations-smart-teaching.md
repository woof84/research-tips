            <p class="card-text"> 
                <blockquote>"A lesson should resonate with more students if it targets visual, tactile, auditory and kinesthetic senses, instead of only one... Not only will these tactics help more students grasp the core concepts of lessons, but make class more engaging."<p>—Marcus Guido, 20 Differentiated Instruction Strategies and Examples</p></blockquote>
