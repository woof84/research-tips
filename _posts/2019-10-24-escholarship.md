The WI+RE team recently published a quick introductory video on eScholarship! eScholarship provides scholarly publishing and repository services that enable departments, research units, publishing programs, and individual scholars associated with the University of California to have direct control over the creation and dissemination of the full range of their scholarship. 

Watch the video below!

For this video, April took the lead, creating drawings by hand, and then importing them into Hype for animation. April, Jen, and Taylor collaborated with stakeholders on the script before Kian and Taylor recorded the voiceover. The video was published just in time for Open Access Week!
