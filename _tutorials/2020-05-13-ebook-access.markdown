<p>Need a book? We've got you covered! Follow this roadmap to find e-Books on reserve and through UCLA Library.</p>

<p>Haven't found it yet? No problem! We'll also show you how to search HathiTrust's Temporary Expanded Access Service, a collaboration of academic libraries preserving a massive collection of scanned books from around the world.</p>

<p>UCLA students, faculty, and staff currently have temporary expanded access to UC library books collected by the HathiTrust Digital Library. </p>

<p>This means that if any UC library has a book in print and in the HathiTrust, you can get temporary access to it electronically through the HathiTrust Emergency Temporary Access Service. Thatâ€™s more than 7 million books!</p>

<p>And, we haven't reached the end of the road quite yet! There's also the National Emergency Library, Interlibrary Loan, and getting in touch with your subject librarian.</p>

<p>Now you have a road map to follow when searching for e-books in the future!</p>

<p>And, as always, UCLA Library is here for you! Let us know how we can help!</p>
