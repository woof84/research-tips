As annotated bibliographies (AB) become more commonly assigned, it is important to not only know what they are, but why they are important. _Annotated Bibliographies_ is an interactive webcomic that walks students through the reasons why their instructor would assign an AB and explains several types of ABs that a student might be asked to create.
