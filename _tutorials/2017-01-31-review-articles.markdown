<p>Looking for an efficient way to get an overview of a body of research on your topic? A review article is a great place to start.</p>

<p>A review article provides an analysis of the state of research on a set of related research questions. Review articles often:</p>

<ul class="browser-default">
    <li>summarize key research findings;</li>
    <li>reference must-read articles;</li>
    <li>describe current areas of agreement as well as controversies and debates;</li>
    <li>point out gaps in knowledge and unanswered questions;</li>
    <li>suggest directions for future research.</li>
</ul>

<img src="{{ '/assets/images/lit-review-article-diagram-1080.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="img-fluid" alt="Review Article" data-caption="Review Article"> 

<p>You can use a review article to get a better understanding of the existing research on a topic, to identify research questions you would like to explore, and to find relevant sources. A review article’s bibliography often contains references to research articles that have made an impact on the field and advanced understanding of a research topic. 
</p>

<p>Reading a review article can save you time and give you a more well-rounded and coherent understanding of your topic.</p>

### Heads Up!

<p>Unlike typical research articles, review articles do not present any original primary research. For this reason, some assignments may not allow you to directly cite a review article in your paper. However, you can still use the article to get a general understanding of the field and to find important primary research articles.</p>

<p>Also note that for most senior theses in the sciences, the proper place to cite a review article is in the first few paragraphs of your introduction.  By placing references to a review article in your early intro, you give your reader a place to go for more information if they are unfamiliar with your field.</p>

<p>Be sure to review the writing prompt and check with your instructor to be sure!</p>

### How do I Find Review Articles? 

Finding a review article is relatively simple, though it varies slightly depending on what database you are using. 

<!-- Start Web of Science -->

        <p>Then, on the results page, look for the “Document Types” filter on the left side of the page.</p>
        <p>Click the checkbox next to "Review" and then click "Refine" to see only the results classified as review articles.</p>
