		<div>Enhanced identification of synergistic and antagonistic emergent interactions among three or more drugs</div>
		<div>Interactions among drugs play a critical role in the killing efficacy of multi-drug treatments. Recent advances in theory and experiment for three-drug interactions enable the search for emergent interactions—ones not predictable from pairwise interactions. Previous work has shown it is easier to detect synergies and antagonisms among pairwise interactions when a rescaling method is applied to the interaction metric. However, no study has carefully examined whether new types of normalization might be needed for emergence. Here, we propose several rescaling methods for enhancing the classification of the higher order drug interactions based on our conceptual framework. To choose the rescaling that best separates synergism, antagonism and additivity, we conducted bacterial growth experiments in the presence of single, pairwise and triple-drug combinations among 14 antibiotics. We found one of our rescaling methods is far better at distinguishing synergistic and antagonistic emergent interactions than any of the other methods. Using our new method, we find around 50% of emergent interactions are additive, much less than previous reports of greater than 90% additivity. We conclude that higher order emergent interactions are much more common than previously believed, and we argue these findings for drugs suggest that appropriate rescaling is crucial to infer higher order interactions.

		<div>The Benefits of Biculturalism: Exposure to Immigrant Culture and Dropping out of School Among Asian and Lation Youths</div>
		<div>This study examines how retaining an immigrant culture affects school dropout rates among Vietnamese, Koreans, Chinese, Filipinos, Japanese, Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and Cubans. I use 1990 Census data to analyze how language use, household language, and presence of immigrants in the household affect dropping out of school. Overall, I found that these measures have similar effects on these diverse groups: bilingual students are less likely to drop out than English-only speakers, students in bilingual households are less likely to drop out than those in English-dominant or English-limited households, and students in immigrant households are less likely to drop out than those in nonimmigrant households. These findings suggest that those who enjoy the greatest educational success are not those who have abandoned their ethnic cultures and are most acculturated. Rather, bicultural youths who can draw resources from both the immigrant community and mainstream society are best situated to enjoy educational success.

		<div>Testing General Relativity with Stellar Orbits around the Supermassive Black Hole in our Galactic Center </div>
		<div>We demonstrate that short-period stars orbiting around the supermassive black hole in our Galactic center can successfully be used to probe the gravitational theory in a strong regime. We use 19 years of observations of the two best measured short-period stars orbiting our Galactic center to constrain a hypothetical fifth force that arises in various scenarios motivated by the development of a unification theory or in some models of dark matter and dark energy. No deviation from general relativity is reported and the fifth force strength is restricted to an upper 95% confidence limit of |α| < 0.016 at a length scale of λ = 150 astronomical units. We also derive a 95% 
confidence upper limit on a linear drift of the argument of periastron of the short-period
star S0-2 of |ωS0-2| < 1.6 × 10−3 rad=yr, which can be used to constrain various 
gravitational and astrophysical theories. This analysis provides the first fully self-consistent test of the gravitational theory using orbital dynamic in a strong 
gravitational regime, that of a supermassive blackhole. A sensitivity analysis for futuremeasurements is also presented.EndFragment</div>

		<div>While previous critics have classified Frances Brooke’s novel The Excursion (1777) as a moral tale aligned with either the sentimental or pastoral tradition, this article makes the case for interpreting The Excursion as a political satire directed against corrupt theatre politics. Reading the plot in the context of contemporary letters, periodicals, and theatrical miscellanies reveals a thick weave of topical allusions to the 1770s London stage and uncovers a buried homage to celebrity actress Mary Ann Yates, Brooke’s friend and business partner. Brooke leverages her novel to promote the interests of her theatrical circle and her own claim to be recognized as one of the great theatre managers of the day--specifically, as the equal to David Garrick. As a satire of theatre politics, The Excursion allows Brooke to mape out a specific vision for what constitutes good acting, how the government should reform its theatre policy, and why accessible theatre is especially crucial for women, creative professionals, and audience members alike.

		<div>Ineffective Abstract:</div>
		<div>I am interested in investigating if students have learned their math facts using online resources as compared to traditional practice tests and flashcards. Using computers in the computer lab, the teacher’s class of 24 students will work at one or more of several different websites that promote learning math facts. Students spent time in the lab each week. Students kept track of their scores and at the end of the project the students note any improvements or decline in their accuracy and time. Results from this year were compared to class averages from the past three years when students only used the traditional practice tests and flash cards to see if students show any improvement over past classes. </div>

		<div>Click here to read about what makes this abstract effective.</div>
		<div>Beginning in 1991, a pilot program was introduced to increase the efficacy of early mathematics education. The program sought to replace traditional flashcard and practice test approaches with computerized adaptive testing (CAT) in 19 schools across Southern California. A study conducted by a ‘No Child Left Beind’ research group in 2002 concluded that the CAT tests were effective and lead to increased student retention of mathematical information. The present research revisits these results 24 years after the introduction of the pilot program and aims to refute the original findings. Drawing from studies with students from 32 classes of approximately 24 students per class (a total of 772 students), data collected over a period of 9 months and analysis of timed score results were compared to the scores of the previous three years. Outcomes proved that there is no discernable difference between using only the CAT or only the flashcard method; rather, a combination of both methods yields the highest increase in mathematical retention over time. The findings of the study have broader implications to fact-based early elementary school education.  </div>
