    <h3>Turn Headings Into Questions</h3>
    <ul class="browser-default activator">
      <li>Restate section headings as questions. For example, a section heading titled, “Youth Social Media Use” could be turned into, “How do youth in different communities use social media? </li>
      <li>As you read and take notes, keep your question in mind. Write down information that answers the question.</li>
      <li>In the end, you should be able to summarize the answer to your question.</li>
      <li>You may need to revise your question if the content doesn't match up.</li>

    <h3>Paraphrase as You Read</h3>
    <ul class="browser-default activator">
      <li>Whenever you encounter an important concept, paraphrase it in your notes or outline.</li>
      <li>Avoid summarizing using the exact words in the text, taking notes verbatim is not nearly as effective as writing in your own words.</li>
      <li>A few words or a sentence will suffice for each summary.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Vary Your Speed for What You Need</h3>
    <ul class="browser-default activator">
      <li>Slow down your reading when you encounter unfamiliar ideas or new information that seems particularly relevant to your class or research context.</li>
      <li>Increase speed when you encounter ideas that you are familiar with or that don’t pertain to your research context or class.</li>
      <li>You can use key phrases to identify when to change your  speed. For example, if you already understand the concept, you can speed up when you see the phrase “for example.” But you might want to slow down when you see something like “Conversely” which indicates a shift or new perspective.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Identify Uncertainties</h3>
    <ul class="browser-default activator">
      <li>Designate a symbol, highlighter color, or other marker that you can use to make note of bits of text that you don’t understand or want more clarification on.</li>
      <li>Make note of what you don’t understand… Then try to move on! </li>
      <li>Don’t get bogged down by uncertainties—this can hinder your ability to comprehend the text as a whole.</li>
      <li>It’s possible your question gets answered later on in the text! But if not, consider visiting your professor or TA to resolve your questions that you cannot answer using the text.</li>
    </ul>
