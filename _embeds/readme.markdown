# What are embeds?

"Embeds" were the WI+RE team's first attempt at creating embeddable instructional modules. Many of the embeds in this folder were created using https://revealjs.com/ and others are simple html or markdown files.

Embeds were intended to be included on other sites and course management systems using <iframe> tags.

Since discovering H5P, WI+RE has largely moved away from embeds, and no longer creates new ones. We have left this directory here in case other institutions are still using them.
